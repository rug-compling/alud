"""Block ud.FixPunct for making sure punctuation is attached projectively.

Punctuation in Universal Dependencies has the tag PUNCT, dependency relation punct,
and is always attached projectively, usually to the head of a neighboring subtree
to its left or right.
Punctuation normally does not have children. If it does, we will fix it first.

This block tries to re-attach punctuation projectively and according to the guidelines.
It should help in cases where punctuation is attached randomly, always to the root
or always to the neighboring word. However, there are limits to what it can do;
for example it cannot always recognize whether a comma is introduced to separate
the block to its left or to its right. Hence if the punctuation before running
this block is almost good, the block may actually do more harm than good.

Since the punctuation should not have children, we should not create a non-projectivity
if we check the root edges going to the right.
However, it is still possible that we will attach the punctuation non-projectively
by joining a non-projectivity that already exists.
For example, the left neighbor (node i-1) may have its parent at i-3,
and the node i-2 forms a gap (does not depend on i-3).
